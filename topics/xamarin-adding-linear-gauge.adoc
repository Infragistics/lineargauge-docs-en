[[Prerequisites]]

=== Prerequisites

To complete the procedure, you need the following:

* Created a project as outlined in the following topic, link:xamarin-project-with-infragistics-controls.html[Creating a Project Using Infragistics Xamarin Controls]

[[Overview]]

=== Overview

Following is a conceptual overview of the process:*1. Adding the {LinearGaugeName} control to {PlatformName} applications*

*2. Verifying the results*

[[Steps]]

=== Steps

The following procedure takes you through the steps necessary for adding the  _{LinearGaugeName}_  control to a page.

=== 1. Add the {LinearGaugeName} control to the page.

[start=1]
. Right click the TestProject project, select Add=>New Item...
[start=2]
. Select Forms Xaml Page, enter TestLinearGaugePage as the name and click Add
[start=3]
. Open the file and enter the following code snippet

ifdef::xaml[]

*In XAML:*

----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<ContentPage xmlns="http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms"
    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
    x:Class="TestLinearGaugeApp.TestLinearGaugePage"
    xmlns:ig="clr-namespace:Infragistics.XF.Controls;assembly=InfragisticsXF.Controls.Gauges" >
   <ig:XFLinearGauge Grid.Row="3"
                    MinimumValue="5"
                    MaximumValue="55"
                    Value="43">
      <ig:XFLinearGauge.Ranges>
         <ig:LinearGraphRange StartValue="5"
                            EndValue="15"
                            Brush="Red" />
         <ig:LinearGraphRange StartValue="15"
                            EndValue="30"
                            Brush="Yellow" />
         <ig:LinearGraphRange StartValue="30"
                            EndValue="55"
                            Brush="Green"/>
      </ig:XFLinearGauge.Ranges>
   </ig:XFLinearGauge>
</ContentPage>
----

endif::xaml[]

[start=4]
. Open the App.cs file and update the GetMainPage with the following code:

*In C#:*

----
public static Page GetMainPage()
{
   return new TestLinearGaugePage();
}
----

=== 2. Verify the results.

Build your project. Select one of the platform's project as the startup project and select run. If you have implemented the steps correctly, the displayed {LinearGaugeName} should look like the one in the Preview section above.
