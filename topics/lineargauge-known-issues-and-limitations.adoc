|<<_singleNeedle,Only needle supported>>
|The _{LinearGaugeName}_ control supports only one needle.

|<<_NoLabelsCollision,No label collisions detection>>
|The _{LinearGaugeName}_ control does not provide means for detecting label collisions. As a result, when the space to visualize the labels is not sufficient, label collisions may occur.

[[_Ref367479792]]
== _{LinearGaugeName}_

[[_singleNeedle]]

=== Only one needle supported

The  _{LinearGaugeName}_   control supports only one needle.

.Workaround
[NOTE]
====
The effect of displaying multiple needles can be achieved by overlaying several instances of the control.
====

[[_NoLabelsCollision]]

=== No label collisions detection

The  _{LinearGaugeName}_   control does not provide means for detecting label collisions. As a result, when the space to visualize the labels is not sufficient, label collisions may occur.

.Workaround
[NOTE]
====
Make sure that in the container of the control there is sufficient space to display the labels properly.
